# courseraMachineLearningStanford

The objective of this repository is to do the exercises of the Machine Learning
Coursera course taught by Adrew Ng using Python. The original exerciser where
programmed using Octave and I will also include them in the repository.
I will not use Scikit-Learn or other Machine Learning (ML) libraries in this
exercises as the objective is to deeply understand the ML algorithms.

I plan to program two implementations for each exercise:
1. Using simple Numpy arrays to represent the data and to build the algorithms.
   This will be a minimal implementation of the basic algorithms taught in the
   course.
2. A *Pythonic* implementation Using Pandas to represent and operate with the
   data.
